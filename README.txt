This is the proof of concept code of a routability driven analytical, quadratic placer which was developed for VLSI CAD coursework. The C# code was made as a rapid prototype and hence a bit dirty. The first project namely "set_TestField" does the vital placement job. After solving the sparse matrix of net and gate connections with the help of an external octave matrix solver, the second project "set_subPart" writes the placed gate and nets in external files.
